# Fitness First Gym 

As my first project i choose one of the suggested idea of building a gym website. Training and working out is something that everybody should take seriously.
So for my first project i wanted to creat a good user expeience which can inspire users to sign up and start working out and avail the benefits of Gym & excercise
 
# UX

This is a static gym website with simple and sleek design. The whole purpose of creating this site is to provide a simple interface and decent design to make it
appealing to the users 

## Demo
A live demo can be found [here](https://rameez1822534.github.io/rameez1822.github.io/).

## User stories 

AS a user i expect to see a website for the gym which serves its purpose to provide me all relevent information.

AS a user i expect a website which enables me to sign up. 

As a user i expect to find out about the fee range and offers which are available. 

## Strategy
My goal in the design was to keep it simple as possible for the users and provide users the information which they suppose to get on a reguler gym website

## Scope
For Users, I wanted to provide them a website where they can find what services as a gym we provide and what is our fee struture 
and our opening times etc , so a user have a nice whole picture of us as a gym 

## Structure
In the Hero section, I wanted users to sign up as by offering "free trial"  and motivational "hero text".
In the benefits section , I wanted users to see the benefits of joining us for example "24/7 opening times".
In the Carousel section, I wanted to show users the features we provide.
In the cards section , i wanted to shoe users the fee struture and spcial offers we have.




## Surface

The grey colour scheme was inspired by number of different websites with my own touch of little green
to provide a smooth and nice look.
